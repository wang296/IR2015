title: Literature Survey
---
Students taking CS 410 for 4 credit hours will be responsible for writing a
literature survey on a topic of their choosing (related this class's material).

# Topic and Length

The topic will be selected by the student with approval of the instructor. Often
the selected topic is related to the course project that the student is
involved in, but it does not have to be. Since the project proposal is due in
the middle of the semester, you should plan to finalize the topic for your
literature review around that time.

The survey will be graded as follows:

* 10% Survey proposal, due June 26 by midnight
* 90% Survey report, due July 11 by midnight

The proposal will be graded pass/fail, and the report will be graded based on a
[rubric]({{site.baseurl}}/survey-rubric.pdf).

Note that you are required to use LaTeX for your literature survey. See the
[Resources]({{site.baseurl}}/resources.html) page for the template and example
file.

# Goal and Structure

The goal of your literature review is to synthesize a set of papers about a
topic. Note that this is different from a simple list of paragraphs covering
each paper; instead, you should try to organize the papers you've read into a
structure and connect them so that you can discuss their similarity and
differences.

Your review should help a reader to see a clear overall picture of the papers
that you reviewed. It is unnecessary to cover many details of any paper as a
reader can and will read the original paper if he or she is interested. That is,
your review is mostly to provide an entry point to the relevant literature.
Picture it as the first reading that someone would look at in order to learn
about research work on the topic and try to write your review for such a reader.

Decide whether you would like to do a broad shallow survey or a narrow deep
survey:

* A broad shallow survey can cover many papers (*e.g.*, more than 10 or even
20 papers), but only briefly mention what is in each paper
* A narrow one can
cover just 6 to 10 papers, but with more detailed description of each paper

Either strategy is acceptable. In the first case, you can read broadly, but you
don't need to read each paper in detail; in the second, you will read fewer
papers, but you will also need to understand each paper in more detail. You may
make this decision based on which strategy would help you most in finishing your
project or based on your own preferences.

# Selecting Papers

Select a set of seed papers first. You can find them by doing general literature
search on the Web and focus on papers that have high citations. Then you can
check which papers have cited them. Focus on newer papers on your topic. It's
better to read the newest papers and go backward to read relatively older
papers. This way, your survey will be reflecting the most recent progress,
making it more useful. If you find any existing survey or review of the topic or
a related topic, read it and try to build on top of it, rather than repeat what
has already been surveyed.

Start reading papers as soon as possible. It takes some time to read a paper,
especially if a paper is complicated; you should act early to ensure you will
be able to read at least 6 papers in detail or 10 papers in a shallow way by the
end of the semester.

If you aren't sure about which papers to focus on, please email the instructor
for a discussion!
