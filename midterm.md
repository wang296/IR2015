title: Midterm Exam
---

The course midterm will be late in the semester (after we have covered most of the lecture content), in a regular class period of 90 minutes. There is no final exam. There will be **no** aids for the exam, such as a laptop/tablet/mobilephone or cheat sheet.

Exam questions include True/False question, short answer questions, and short essay questions. 

A review lecture will be given prior to the exam. Practice midterm exam will be provided one week before the exam.

A [practice midterm]({{site.baseurl}}/practice-midterm.html) is provided from the Spring 2014 offering in UIUC. The format and coverage of our midterm will be slightly different from this one.  

Important topics for the coming midterm exam have been listed [here]({{site.baseurl}}/midterm-list.html).  

The solutions of our midterm exam questions can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/PDFs/midterm-solution.pdf).
