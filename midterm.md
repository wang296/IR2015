title: Midterm Exam
---

We will have one midterm and one final exam. Both exams are in a regular class period of 75 minutes. There will be **no** aids for the exams, such as a laptop/tablet/mobilephone or cheat sheet.

Exam questions include True/False question, short answer questions, and short essay questions. 

Important topics for the coming midterm exam have been listed [here]({{site.baseurl}}/midterm-list.html).
