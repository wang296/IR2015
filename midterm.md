title: Midterm Exam
---

We will have one midterm and one final exam. Both exams are in a regular class period of **75 minutes**. There will be **no** aids for the exams, such as a laptop/tablet/mobilephone or cheat sheet.

Exam questions include True/False question, short answer questions, and short essay questions. 

Important topics for the coming midterm exam have been listed [here]({{site.baseurl}}/midterm-list).  

A [sample midterm]([PDF]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/midterm/midterm-solution-2014Fall.pdf) is provided from the Fall 2014 offering. The format and coverage of our midterm will be slightly different from this one (Note: 1. we will only cover the topics up to classical IR evaluation, and the concepts from modern IR evaluation will not be included; 2. our exam time is **75 minutes**).
