title: Midterm Exam
---

We will have one midterm and one final exam. Both exams are in a regular class period of 90 minutes. There will be **no** aids for the exams, such as a laptop/tablet/mobilephone or cheat sheet.

Exam questions include True/False question, short answer questions, and short essay questions. 

A review lecture will be given prior to the exams. Practice exams will be provided one week before the exam.
