## Lecture V: Relevance Feedback

> User feedback is important for retrieval systems to evaluate the performance and improve the effectiveness of their service strategies. However, in most practical system, only implicit feedback can be collected from users, e.g., clicks, which are known to be noisy and biased. We will discuss how to properly model implicit user feedback, and enhance retrieval performance via such feedback.
