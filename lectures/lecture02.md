## Announcements
- mp1 released on Friday, 6/6, due next Friday 6/13
- Reminder: Sean's office hours tomorrow at 3pm in this room (1304)
 * We can talk about project ideas, research ideas, CS 225, etc...
- Please sign up for Piazza (currently only about half of you are)
- Google calendar works

## Review
- What did we talk about yesterday?
- (there isn't one correct answer)

## Lecture plan
- Intro (information overload!)
- TIS (information access) modes
- Text retrieval (access) and text mining
- sp14 project list

## Information overload: how much information is there?
- [Source](http://www.businessinsider.com/24-mind-blowing-facts-about-business-2013-6?op=1)
- 1999: 38 million had broadband internet; 2013: 1.2 billion people have it...
  ion their phones. Facebook has half of its 150 million views from mobile
- Reddit has 62.3 million *unique* visitors per month and serves 4.4 billion
  web pages... they have 22 employees.
- Internet: 14.3 trillion pages
- [Source](http://www.factshunt.com/2014/01/total-number-of-websites-size-of.html)
- 48 billion pages indexed by Google (but can we see all of them?)
- In 2013, 672 Exabytes of accessible data
- 1 Yottabyte of total data stored on internet... 1e24 bytes

## Specifically, text info
- Most natural way of encoding knowledge
- Text info can describe any other type of data (video, etc)
- Most basic and most useful

## Text informations systems applications
- Retrieval (access)
- Mining
- Organization (processing)

## Push
- Push notification on phones. Tell me a flight is delayed
- [Google scholar](http://scholar.google.com/), when are there new papers that
  might be of interest to me? (personalized! accessible on phone)
- Weather, local or world news, RSS feed, etc
- Can someone name another one?

## Pull
- Search engine!
- Works well when user has specific information need
- Divided into two parts

## Querying vs Browsing (part of pull)
- **Querying**
- What is a vertical search engine?
- **Browsing**
- Wikipedia browsing categories and portals (go there!)
- [Google knowledge
  graph](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html),
  semantic search, query understanding, exploratory search
- [Music map](http://www.music-map.com/)
- Querying is faster, but browsing is useful when querying fails or a user
  wants to explore

## Class quiz! (self grade)
- True or false: the final project paper needs to be written in LaTeX.
- True or false: the official class textbook is Introduction to Information
  Retrieval. Manning, Raghavan, and Schuetze.
- True or false: the class is curved so that the average final grade is a B-/C+
  borderline
- True or false: if two events ($A$ and $B$) are independent, then $P(A,B) =
  P(A)P(B)$
- True or false: if two events ($A$ and $B$) are independent, then $P(A) = P(A|B)$
- What is the name of this statement: $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

## Conceptual framework of a TIS
- Diagram with Mining

## TIS and other areas
- Intersection of TIS and information science
- HCI to compression (wide range of applications)
- Very wide array of concepts... your projects can be in any of these areas!

## General challenges
- NLP difficulty, unrestricted domain
- Vague information need, and hard to evaluate (what is the correct answer?)
- Effective and efficient

## Views on Text Mining
- Data mining: explore patterns in textual data
- NLP: information extraction, knowledge representation + inferences

## Previous semester projects
- [Check them
  out](https://wiki.engr.illinois.edu/display/timan/CS410S14+Project+Presentation+Schedule)
- Not sure if you will be able to access these... if not, we can go over them
  again and I can make a list

## What you should know
- TIS applications (text retrieval vs text mining)
- Pull vs push
- Querying vs browsing
- Role of NLP in TIS

## Next time
- An overview of NLP
